Click each tab below, to learn more!</p> Contoso Web (Chat UI)Contoso Chat (Chat AI) <p>Contoso Outdoors is an enterprise retailer that sells a wide variety of hiking and camping equipment to outdoor adventurer through their website. Customers visiting the site often call the customer support line with requests for product information or recommendations, before making their purchases. The retailer decides to build and integrate an AI-based customer support agent (retail copilot) to handle these queries right from their website, for efficiency.</p> <p></p> <p>Contoso Chat is the chat AI implementation (backend) for the retail copilot experience. It has a hosted API (endpoint) that the chat UI (frontend) can interact with to process user requests. Customers can now ask questions in a conversational format, using natural language, and get valid responses grounded in product data and their own purchase history.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"1-Concepts/01-Introduction/02-RAG-Pattern/","title":"2. The RAG Pattern","text":"<p>The workshop teaches you to build, evaluate, and deploy a retail copilot code-first on Azure AI - using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) design pattern to make sure that our copilot responses are grounded in the (private) data maintained by the enterprise, for this application.</p> <p></p> <p>Let's learn how this design pattern works in the context of our Contoso Chat application. Click on the tabs in order, to understand the sequence of events shown in the figure above.</p> 1. Get Query2. Vectorize Query3. Retrieve Matches4. Augment Query5. Generate Response <p>The user query arrives at our copilot implementation via the endpoint (API)</p> <p>Our deployed Contoso Chat application is exposed as a hosted API endpoint using Azure Container Apps. The incoming \"user query\" has 3 components: the user question (text input), the user's customer ID (text input), and an optional chat history (object array).</p> <p>The API server extracts these parameters from the incoming request, and invokes the Contoso Chat application - starting the workflow reflecting this RAG design pattern.</p> <p>The copilot sends the text query to a retrieval service after first vectorizing it.</p> <p>The Contoso Chat application converts the text question into a vectorized query using a Large Language \"Embedding\" Model (e.g., Azure Open AI <code>text-embedding-ada-002</code>). This is then sent to the information retrieval service (e.g., Azure AI Search) in the next step.</p> <p>The retrieval service uses vectorized query to return matching results by similarity</p> <p>The information retrieval service maintains a search index for relevant information (here, for our product catalog). In this step, we use the vectorized query from the previous step to find and return matching product results based on vector similarity. The information retrieval service can also use features like semantic ranking to order the returned results.</p> <p>The copilot augments user prompt with retrieved knowledge in request to model</p> <p>The Contoso Chat application combines the user's original question with returned \"documents\" from the information retrieval service, to create an enhanced model prompt. This is made easier using prompt template technologies (e.g., Prompty) with placeholders - for chat history, retrieved documents, and customer profile information - that are filled in at this step.</p> <p>The chat model uses prompt to generate a grounded response to user question.</p> <p>This enhanced prompt is now sent to the Large Language \"chat\" model (e.g., Azure OpenAI <code>gpt-35-turbo</code> or <code>gpt-4o</code>) which sees the enhanced prompt (retrieved documents, customer profile data, chat history) as grounding context for generating the final response, improving the quality (e.g., relevance, groundedness) of results returned from Contoso Chat.</p>"},{"location":"1-Concepts/01-Introduction/03-App-Architecture/","title":"3.

The App Lifecycle","text":"<p>Building generative AI applications requires an iterative process of refinement from prompt to production. The application  lifecycle (GenAIOps) is best illustrated by the three stages shown:</p> <ol> <li>Ideation - involves building the initial prototype, validating it manually with a test prompt.</li> <li>Evaluation - involves assessing it for quality and safety with large, diverse test datasets.</li> <li>Operationalization - involves deploying it for real-world usage &amp; monitoring it for insights.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Building these solutions end-to-end requires not just a paradigm shift, but also robust developer tooling that can be tailored to suit every stage of the lifecycle. The figure below shows the rich tooling support in Azure AI Foundry today.

This includes creating the Azure AI project (resources, models) and support services (Azure CosmosDB, Azure AI Search, Azure Container Apps). By the end of this step, you should have created an Azure resource group.</p> <p>This step is completed for you in instructor-led sessions.</p> <p>Setup the development environment for your project. This involves forking the sample repo to your own profile, launching GitHub Codespaces to get a pre-built development environment and configure it to talk to your provisioned Azure infrastructure. By the end of this step, you should be ready to start the ideation step of development.</p> <p>Go from first prompt to functional prototype. This involves creating a prompt template, configuring it to use a deployed chat model, then using a sample input to iterate on the prompt template design till a satisfactory response is returned. By the end of this step, you should have a Prompty asset and a Python application script for Contoso Chat.</p> <p>Assess response quality with larger test dataset. This involves creating a test dataset, creating custom evalators (for quality metrics) and orchestrating an AI-assisted evaluation workflow to scores responses from our application before we can deploy to production. By the end of this step, you should be ready to take the prototype to production.</p> <p>Deploy application to get a hosted API endpoint. This involves creating an API application server (using FastAPI), packaging it up in am Azure Container App, and deploying it to Azure using <code>azd deploy</code>.
