## Session Description

In this workshop, attendees will be introduced to the concept of GenAIOps, and learn to build a custom RAG-based retail copilot end-to-end, _code-first_ on the Azure AI platform.

Using the provided sample, attendees will learn to prototype, evaluate and deploy a customer support chat AI for _Contoso Outdoors_ - a fictitious retailer who sells hiking and camping equipment online. The sample uses a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to implement a retail copilot solution that responds to customer queries with answers grounded in the retailer's product catalog and customer purchase history. 

## Application Architecture

Attendees will also learn the components of an Azure AI application architecture for implementing a custom copilot solution. User input ("question") to a frontend chat UI or client is sent to a hosted copilot endpoint on Azure Container Apps. The query is then routed to various processing services in an orchestrated RAG workflow that generates the relevant response - which is returned to the user through the frontend client.

The orchestration involves three processing services. The _Azure AI Search service_ manages product indexes for the retailer's catalog, returning matching items for user queries based on similarity search and semantic ranking. The _Azure CosmosDB service_ maintains a noSQL database with customer order history, returning product recommendations based on prior purchases. The _Azure OpenAI service_ manages model deployments for embeddings, chat and evaluation - key capabilities required to implement the query vectortization, response generation, and quality assessment steps of our end-to-end application lifecycle.

## Responsible AI 

Microsoft is committed to helping our customers use our AI products responsibly, sharing our learnings, and building trust-based partnerships through tools like Transparency Notes and Impact Assessments. Many of these resources can be found at [https://aka.ms/RAI](https://aka.ms/RAI).
Microsoft’s approach to responsible AI is grounded in our AI principles of fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.

Large-scale natural language, image, and speech models - like the ones used in this sample - can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive, in turn causing harms. Please consult the [Azure OpenAI service Transparency note](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text) to be informed about risks and limitations.

The recommended approach to mitigating these risks is to include a safety system in your architecture that can detect and prevent harmful behavior. [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) provides an independent layer of protection, able to detect harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services. Azure AI Content Safety includes text and image APIs that allow you to detect material that is harmful. Within Azure AI Foundry, the Content Safety service allows you to view, explore and try out sample code for detecting harmful content across different modalities. The following [quickstart documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-text?tabs=visual-studio%2Clinux&pivots=programming-language-rest) guides you through making requests to the service.

Another aspect to take into account is the overall application performance. With multi-modal and multi-models applications, we consider performance to mean that the system performs as you and your users expect, including not generating harmful outputs. It's important to assess the performance of your overall application using [Performance and Quality and Risk and Safety evaluators](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in). You also have the ability to create and evaluate with [custom evaluators](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/evaluate-sdk#custom-evaluators).

You can evaluate your AI application in your development environment using the [Azure AI Evaluation SDK](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/index.html). Given either a test dataset or a target, your generative AI application generations are quantitatively measured with built-in evaluators or custom evaluators of your choice. To get started with the azure ai evaluation sdk to evaluate your system, you can follow the [quickstart guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/flow-evaluate-sdk). Once you execute an evaluation run, you can [visualize the results in Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/evaluate-flow-results).
