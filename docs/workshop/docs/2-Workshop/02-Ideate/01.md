# 3.1 Create a New Prompty

!!! info "The GitHub Codespaces environment is preconfigured with Prompty tooling to help us create, convert, and run, Prompty assets. Let's start by creating an empty **sandbox/** folder to start our ideation from scratch."

---

## 1. Create Sandbox Folder

1. Open the VS Code terminal in GitHub Codespaces.
1. Run this command to create a new empty sandbox folder:
    ``` title="" linenums="0"
    mkdir sandbox
    ```
1. Change to the directory in the terminal.
    ``` title="" linenums="0"
    cd sandbox
    ```


---

## 2. Create New Prompty

1. Open the VS Code "File Explorer" view and locate the `sandbox/` folder
1. Click on it to get a dropdown menu - look for the `New Prompty` option shown

    ![prompty](./../../img/new-prompty.png)

1. Click on it -  this creates a `basic.prompty` file and opens it in VS Code


## 3. Explore Prompty Asset

1. View the  `basic.prompty` asset in your VS Code Editor. 

    ??? info "(Click to expand) The starter Prompty asset looks like this:"

        ```yaml title="basic.prompty"

        authors:
            - Seth Juarez
        model:
            api: chat
            configuration:
                type: azure_openai
                azure_endpoint: ${env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}
                azure_deployment: <your-deployment>
                api_version: 2024-07-01-preview
            parameters:

                The Alpine Explorer Tent boasts a detachable divider for privacy, 
                numerous mesh windows and adjustable vents for ventilation, and 
                a waterproof design. It even has a built-in gear loft for storing 
                your outdoor essentials. In short, it's a blend of privacy, comfort, 
                and convenience, making it your second home in the heart of nature!
            question: What can you tell me about your tents?

        system:
        You are an AI assistant who helps people find information. As the assistant, 
        you answer questions briefly, succinctly, and in a personable manner using 
        markdown and even add some personal flair with appropriate emojis.

        # Customer
        You are helping {{firstName}} to find answers to their questions.
        Use their name to address them in your responses.

        # Context
        Use the following context to provide a more personalized response to {{firstName}}:
        {{context}}

        user:
        {{question}}
        ```

1. You will observe the following:

    1. The asset uses a YAML format with frontmatter (top) and content (bottom)
    1. The frontmatter has app metadata, model parameters, and sample data
    1. The template has a system message, user question, context and instructions

Note how the asset captures all the elements typically found in a model playground, for prompt engineering. All we need is a **runtime** to execute the prompt by invoking the model.


## 4. Run The Prompty

The Prompty extension provides a built-in runtime we can use for this purpose. Let's try it!

1. Open the `basic.prompty` file in the VS Code editor.
1. Click the _play icon_ seen at top-right corner (or press F5).
1. You will be prompted to sign into Azure as shown. Click `Allow`.

    ![The extension 'Prompty' wants to sign in using Microsoft.](./../../img/prompty-auth.png)

1. Complete the auth flow. This allows Prompty to invoke the Azure-deployed model.
1. Prompty executes the request and displays response in the VS Code Terminal.

    !!! danger "NOTE: This step will fail with an error. Don't worry, that's expected."

        Your Visual Studio Code terminal will switch to the "Output" tab and display this message:
        > ‚ùå | ` Error: 404 The API deployment for this resource does not exist.`

We'll debug this error - and start our first iteration of this ideation process, next!

!!! success "CONGRATULATIONS. You created and ran your first Prompty!"
