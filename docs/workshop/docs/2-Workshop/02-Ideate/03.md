# 3.3: Add Instructions & Data

!!! info "ITERATION STEP 1: Let's update the frontmatter to configure model parameters and shape our data context"

## 1. Rename Prompty Asset

Let's reflect the start of a new iteration by renaming our prompty asset. Make sure you are still in the `sandbox/` folder - then run this command:

```title="" linenums="0"
mv chat-0.prompty chat-1.prompty
```

---

## 2. Before ‚Üí Identify Fixes

Let's open this file in the Visual Studio Code editor and identify changes for this iteration:

- [X] **Add Model Parameters:** Adding temperature can help us modify response creativity.
- [X] **Update System Persona:** Personalize greetings using the customer data.
- [X] **Define Data Inputs:** We need to represent data for RAG (e.g. customer orders)
- [X] **Use Sample File:** Support more complex object formats (e.g., "shape" RAG data)
- [X] **Update System Context** Lines 20-23 should reflect customer service scenario.
- [X] **Update Template Content** Add instructions for scenario, use new inputs

        you answer questions briefly, succinctly, and in a personable manner using 
        markdown and even add some personal flair with appropriate emojis.

        # Customer
        You are helping {{firstName}} to find answers to their questions.
        Use their name to address them in your responses.

        # user
        {{question}}

        ```

Let's make these changes, next - and then run the modified asset!

## 3. After ‚Üí Apply Fixes

1. As before, let's copy over the prompty asset with these fixes applied:

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    cp ../docs/workshop/src/1-build/chat-1.prompty .
    ```

1. But this time, we also need to copy over the sample data file associated with it:

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    cp ../docs/workshop/src/1-build/chat-1.json .
    ```

1. This is what our second iteration looks like. 
    - [X] Study the sample data and the prompty asset below
    - [X] See how asset "input" (`customer`) maps to sample object
    - [X] The customer data can now be used in template (`customer.firstName`)
    - [X] Note the `# Previous Orders` section - provides grounding context
    - [X] Note the `Instructions` - clarifies usage of grounding context (RAG)

## 4. Run The Prompty

1. Reload `chat-1.prompty` in the VS Code editor to refresh it.
1. Run the refreshed prompty (using the _play icon_ or by clicking F5)

    !!! success "You should see a valid response (like this) in the Visual Studio Code terminal"

        ```bash title=""  linenums="0"
        Hey John! üòä 

        To complement your **Alpine Explorer Tent**, I recommend the **AlpineGear Cold-Weather Sleeping Bag**. 
        This sleeping bag is designed for chilly nights, ensuring you stay warm and cozy while camping. 
        Its lightweight design makes it easy to pack, and it fits perfectly inside your tent. 

        Happy camping! üèïÔ∏è‚ú®

        ```

Let's compare this to the previous step:

- [X] Do you see how the greeting is influenced by system context?
- [X] Do you see how the response is now grounded in customer data?
- [X] Do you see how response format is influenceed by the instructions?
