# 3.5 Convert Prompty To Code

!!! info "FINAL STEP: How can we convert the asset into a code executable?"

### 1. Get `chat-3.prompty` (final)

Our goal was to build up to the Contoso Chat application. Let's see how close we came by copying over the _final_ version of the prompty asset and data files from our staged area.

1. Get the final `chat.prompty` asset:

    ``` title=""
    cp ../docs/workshop/src/1-build/chat-3.prompty .
    ```

1. Get the final `chat.json` data:

    ``` title=""
    cp ../docs/workshop/src/1-build/chat-3.json .
    ```

### 2. Explore Final Updates

1. **Open the `chat-3.json` file in your Visual Studio Code editor**. The sample data now has a _documentation_ section that represents a product item.

    ```json title=""
        "documentation": {
            "id": "1",
            "title": "Alpine Explorer Tent",
            "name": "Alpine Explorer Tent",
            "content": "Welcome to the joy of camping with the Alpine Explorer Tent! This robust, 8-person, 3-season marvel is from the responsible hands of the AlpineGear brand. Promising an enviable setup that is as straightforward as counting sheep, your camping experience is transformed into a breezy pastime. Looking for privacy? The detachable divider provides separate spaces at a moment's notice. Love a tent that breathes?

    ```


1.  **Open the `chat-3.prompty` file in your Visual Studio Code editor**. The asset now defines a _documentation_ input and uses it in the template as follows:

    ```yaml title="" 
        # Documentation
        The following documentation should be used in the response. The response should specifically include the product id.

        {% for item in documentation %}
        catalog: {{item.id}}
        item: {{item.title}}
        content: {{item.content}}
        {% endfor %}

        Make sure to reference any documentation used in the response.
    ```

1. **Run the `chat-3.prompty` to see the final response**. Observe how the response now identifies the _product item_ in conjunction with a prior customer purchase. _This shows how our application grounds data in two different sources - customer history and product catalog_.

    !!! success "You should see a valid response (like this) in the Visual Studio Code terminal"

        ```bash title=""  linenums="0"

        Hello John Smith! ðŸ˜Š 

        To complement your **Alpine Explorer Tent**, I recommend the **Arctic Explorer Sleeping Bag**. This sleeping bag is designed for cold-weather camping, providing excellent insulation and comfort. It's perfect for those chilly nights under the stars, ensuring you stay warm and cozy while enjoying the great outdoors. 
        ```

### 3. Convert To Code

!!! info "We have a working prototype - in `.prompty` format. Let's convert this to code so we can orchestrate complex flows to integrate with data sources in real world contexts."

1. Open the File Explorer pane in Visual Studio Code and find `chat-3.prompty`.
1. Click to see the drop-down menu. Select _"Add Code > Add Prompty Code"_. 
    - [X] This creates a new Python file `chat-3.py` and opens it in VS Code.
    - [X] You may also see a `prompty.json` file created with model configuration information.

1. Run the `chat-3.py` by clicking the play icon.

    !!! danger "The run will fail with this error. Don't worry -  this is expected!" 

        ValueError: Variable AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT not found in environment

This is because the code is missing a vital import. Let's fix that, next!

### 4. Update Default Code

!!! info "We need to add code to load environment variables from `.env` before using them in code.`"   

1. Add the three lines below to the top of `chat-3.py`:

    ```python title="chat-3.py"
    ## Load environment variables
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()
    ```
        
1. Run `chat-3.py` again. You should now see a valid response being generated. 

    !!! info "You may see error traces occasionally at the end of the run. You can ignore those for now."

    Prompty is currenty in preview and is actively being updated so expect these tools and features to keep evolving.

<!--
    !!! tip "Press Alt-Z (or Cmd-Z on Mac) to toggle word wrap. This will make the prompts in the `.prompty` file easier to read within the limited screen view."
-->

!!! task "Cleanup your sandbox!"

    This completes the **Ideation** stage - don't forget to clean up the temporary sandbox we setup! You no longer need the `sandbox/` folder so feel free to delete that from VS Code to keep the original app in focus.

!!! success "CONGRATULATIONS. Your learned to go from prompt to prototype with IDEATION!"
