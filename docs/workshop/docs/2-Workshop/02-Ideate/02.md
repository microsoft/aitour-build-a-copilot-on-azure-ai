# 3.2: Update Prompt Metadata

!!! info "THIS IS ITERATION STEP 0 - our starting prompty."

    To reflect the iterative process, we'll copy the prompty from the previous stage, to a new prompty file - and bump up the version number used in the prefix. **Make sure you are in the sandbox/ folder - then run this command:**

    ```title="" linenums="0"
    cp basic.prompty chat-0.prompty
    ```

---

**Let's start by identifying the fixes to make. We'll then make these at one shot at the end!**

## 1. Fix 1: Model Configuration

1. Open `chat-0.prompty` file in VS Code and look at the `model` section.
1. The *azure_deployment* property value is not set correctly (line 11).
1. We need to replace `<your-deployment>` with `gpt-4o-mini` (deployment name).

    ```yaml title="chat-0.prompty"  linenums="0"
    model:
        api: chat
        configuration:
            type: azure_openai
            azure_endpoint: ${env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}
            azure_deployment: <your-deployment>
            api_version: 2024-07-01-preview
        parameters:
            max_tokens: 3000
    ```

---

## 2. Fix 2: App Metadata

1. The `name`, `description`, and `authors` properties are at the top of the file.
1. We need to update the following lines, to make them more descriptive of our app.

    ```yaml title=""  linenums="0"
    ---
    name: ExamplePrompt
    description: A prompt that uses context to ground an incoming question
    authors:
    - Seth Juarez
    ```

---

## 3. Fix 3: Remove Context

1. The default asset specifies context that is not relevant - so let's remove it.
1. We need to remove the `context` property defined under the _sample_ object.
    ```yaml title=""  linenums="0"
    sample:
        firstName: Seth
        context: >
            The Alpine Explorer Tent boasts a detachable divider for privacy, 
            numerous mesh windows and adjustable vents for ventilation, and 
            a waterproof design. It even has a built-in gear loft for storing 
            your outdoor essentials. In short, it's a blend of privacy, comfort, 
            and convenience, making it your second home in the heart of nature!
        question: What can you tell me about your tents?
    ```
1.  And we need to remove the template content section that was using it:
    ```yaml title=""  linenums="0"
    # Context
    Use the following context to provide a more personalized response to {{firstName}}:
    {{context}}
    ```
---

## 4. Apply The Fixes

The prompty asset uses YAML which can be sensitive to copy/paste issues that don't preserve the right indentation. For convenience, we'll simply copy over a version with fixes made.

1. Run this command to magically apply these fixes to your prompty

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    cp ../docs/workshop/src/1-build/chat-0.prompty .
    ```
    
    ??? info "(Click to expand) Your patched `chat-0.prompty` will look like this:"

        ```yaml title="chat-0.prompty"

        name: Contoso Chat Prompt
        description: A retail assistant for Contoso Outdoors products retailer.
        authors:
            - Nitya Narasimhan
        model:
            api: chat
            configuration:
                type: azure_openai
                azure_deployment: gpt-4o-mini
                azure_endpoint: ${ENV:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}
                api_version: 2024-08-01-preview
            parameters:
                max_tokens: 3000
        sample:
            firstName: Nitya
            question: What can you tell me about your tents?

## 5. Run Updated Prompty

1. Re-open `chat-0.prompty` (to get the refreshed file)
1. Run the prompty (using the _play icon_ or by clicking F5)
1. You should now see the Visual Studio Code output pane show something like this

    ```bash title=""  linenums="0"

    Hello Nitya! üòä

    I can‚Äôt provide details about a specific company‚Äôs tents, but generally, tents come in various types including:

    - **Dome Tents:** Great for easy setup and stability.
    - **Backpacking Tents:** Lightweight and compact for hiking.
    - **Family Tents:** Spacious with room for multiple people.
    - **Pop-Up Tents:** Quick to pitch, perfect for casual outings.

    They vary by material, weather resistance, and features like vestibules or built-in storage. If you‚Äôre looking for something specific, let me know! üèïÔ∏è‚ú®

    ```
