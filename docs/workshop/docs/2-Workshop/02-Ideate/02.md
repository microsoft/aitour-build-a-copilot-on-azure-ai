# 3.2: Customize To App

!!! info "ITERATION STEP 0: Let's fix the error and customize the defaults!"

## 1. Rename Prompty Asset

Our final application is `chat.prompty`. Let's reflect that by renaming the starter asset to `chat-0.prompty`. We can then bump up the nunber with each step, giving us an intuitive sense of the iterative nature of prompt engineering. 

**Make sure you are in the sandbox/ folder** - then run this command!

```title="" linenums="0"
cp basic.prompty chat-0.prompty
```

## 2. Before ‚Üí Identify Fixes

Look at the file contents (below). Let's identify the fixes to make in this iteration:

- [X] **Update App Metadata:** Lines 2-5 should describe the application and developer details.
- [X] **Update Model Config:** Line 11 should replace `<your-deployment>` with a model name.
- [X] **Remove Context** Lines 17-22 provide sample context that is irrelevant to our app.
- [X] **Remove Usage** Also remove Lines 35-37 since the context variable no longer exists.

## 3. After ‚Üí Apply Fixes

1. For convenience, we've got staged versions that have these fixes completed. Let's copy that over.

    ```bash title="" linenums="0"
    cp ../docs/workshop/src/1-build/chat-0.prompty .
    ```

1. This is what our first iteration looks like. Let's run this next to validate the fixes.

## 4. Run The Prompty

1. Reload `chat-0.prompty` in the VS Code editor to refresh it.
1. Run the refreshed prompty (using the _play icon_ or by clicking F5)

    !!! success "You should see a valid response (like this) in the Visual Studio Code terminal"

        ```bash title=""  linenums="0"

        Hello Nitya! üòä

        I can‚Äôt provide details about a specific company‚Äôs tents, but generally, tents come in various types including:

        - **Dome Tents:** Great for easy setup and stability.
        - **Backpacking Tents:** Lightweight and compact for hiking.
        - **Family Tents:** Spacious with room for multiple people.
        - **Pop-Up Tents:** Quick to pitch, perfect for casual outings.

        They vary by material, weather resistance, and features like vestibules or built-in storage. If you‚Äôre looking for something specific, let me know! üèïÔ∏è‚ú®

        ```

**Note**: Generative AI models are stochastic, meaning that the same query will not always generate the same response. Your output may look different - but this validates that the previous error is fixed.
