## Build a Retail Copilot Code-First on Azure AI

These instructions are for participants of the Workshop "Build a Retail Copilot Code-First on Azure AI" at Microsoft AI Tour 2024-2025. The workshop is offered as an **instructor-led** session (WRK550) on the **Prototype to Production** track:

> In this workshop, attendees will be introduced to the concept of GenAIOps, and learn to build a custom RAG-based retail copilot end-to-end, _code-first_ on the Azure AI platform.
>
> Using the provided sample, attendees will learn to prototype, evaluate and deploy a customer support chat AI for _Contoso Outdoors_ - a fictitious retailer who sells hiking and camping equipment online. The sample uses a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to implement a retail copilot solution that responds to customer queries with answers grounded in the retailer's product catalog and customer purchase history.

## Pre-Requisites

To participate in the instructor-led workshop you will need the following:

1. **Your own laptop.** - It need only be capable of running a browser and GitHub Codespaces. We recommend using a recent version of the Edge, Chrome or Safari browser.
1. **A GitHub Account.** - You can [sign up for a free account](https://github.com/signup) if needed. Once you complete the workshop, you will have a personal fork of the sample (with workshop instructions) to continue exploring at home.
1. _recommended_: **Familiarity with Visual Studio Code.** - We will run all code in GitHub Codespaces and use VS Code Online as our primary development environment in it.
1. _preferred_: **Familiarity with the `bash` shell.** - We'll use it in the VS Code terminal for command-line execution of tasks and scripts, including for Azure CLI commands.
1. _preferred_: **Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks** - We'll be creating Python scripts and running them from the command line and from Notebooks.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you are working on this at home, using the **Self-Guided** option, you also need:

1. **Active Azure Subscription** - with access to the relevant resources and AI model deployments required for this workshop.
1. **Manual Provisioning Step** - you will need to provision the infrastructure yourself by manually running required commands (`azd up`).

## Get Started

To get started, you will need to:

1. launch the Skillable Lab (in the Microsoft AI Tour instructor-led session) to get access to the relevant Azure subscription credentials. 
1. fork the [contoso-chat](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-chat) sample (with branches) 
1. switch to the `aitour-WRK550` branch & launch GitHub Codespaces
1. then follow the workshop instructions as described below

## View Instructions

The workshop instructions are available in the repository under the [`docs/workshop`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-chat/tree/main/docs/workshop/docs) folder as readable Markdown files. The content is authored in Markdown and is readable directly from source. However, for convenience, you can use one of these two options to get a _rendered preview_ as shown below, which may be easier to navigate.

### **Option 1: View Online Preview**

Visit [https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat/workshop](https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat/workshop) in your browser:
- get an interactive hosted preview of this workshop guide you can explore now.
- bookmark and revisit it (_we will keep it updated for the duration of the tour_)

### **Option 2: View Local Preview**

Launch GitHub Codespaces on your fork of the repo, then get the local preview by:
 - changing to the workshop directory in a terminal: `cd docs/workshop`
 - running the preview server: `mkdocs serve -a localhost:5000`

You will see a dialog pop-up with options to view this in browser or in VS Code.
